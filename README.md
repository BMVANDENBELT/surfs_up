# surfs_up
-------------
OVERVIEW
- The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the temperature trends in order to better understand when our friend W.Avy should open the surfing shop. We looked at June and December weather data for a potential location (Oahu). We used data retreival to get the temperatures for Oahu.
- We used Jupyter Notebook, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and VS Code
-------------
RESULTS
- The results for the temperatures of the two months are shown below

SUMMARY
- Both sets of data are relatively the same besides a slight variation in a few points (8 degrees) where the rest are within 2-4 degrees of one another.
- The average temperature for both months lands around the 70s.
- Oahu seems to have a stable temperature that would provide a great place to open a surf shop.

2 ADDITIONAL QUERIES THAT COULD BE PERFORMED
- Because the temperatures are so similar in June and December, there would not be a dramatic change in the amount of icecream that was purchased. On the other hand, 2 months is not a big enough reservoir to pull data from. If we were to take the data from each month, over 5 years, and compare them respectively, we may see just how different the temperatures have changed or a trend they may follow.
- On the surfing side of the table, (and as a fan of surfing myself) it would be incredibly important to monitor windspeeds on the coast over a period of time. The measurements of the wind speeds could help determine the optimal hours that the shop should be open. As the winter rolls around, the wind speeds tend to increase because the moving mass of cold air is at a much lower temperature than the air being displaced.
